   For example:
   ```python
    INSTRUCTION_PROMPTS = {
        0: "Key Points Extraction: 'Extract key points from the following text:'",
        1: "Summarization: 'Summarize the following text:'",

   ```

   - A list of available key names can be found [here](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#pynput.keyboard.Key).


## üìã Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   - The application will listen in the background for you to press the shortcut key and will open the instruction prompt window.
   ```bash
   python querypop.py
   ```

3. **Select Text**: Select the text you wish to send with your prompt. Press your configured Shortcut Key. It will automatically copy the selected text.

   </p>

4. **Input the Instruction Prompt:**

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/querypop_4.jpg" alt="Instruction Prompt Window" />
   </p>
   
   - You can enter your custom prompt and press **OK**, which will be passed to the LLM along with your selected text in the clipboard.
   - You can press 0-9 keys on your keyboard which will pass that Instruction prompt mapped from the `config.py` along with the text in the clipboard.
   - Key bindings are available only from 0-9, if you have more instructions prompts, you will have to manually scroll and press the button.
   - If you wish to bypass this and want to hardcode a single instruction into the application, use `QueryPop v1`.
  
5. **Processing**: The application will automatically process the text and display `‚öôÔ∏è Processing` in a pop-up window.

   </p>
6. **Final Output**: The application will display the result in the same pop-up window.

   </p>

## ‚ùó Error Handling

If no text is found in the clipboard, an error message will be displayed in a pop-up window. Errors related to the API will be displayed in the Processing window.

## üíæ Saving Responses

Responses are saved as `.txt` files in the directory as defined in `QueryPop/responses`. 
If the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. Each file is named with a timestamp for easy tracking.
