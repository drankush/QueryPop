# QueryPop üéâ

QueryPop is a Python application called with a hotkey, that sends selected text (or last from clipboard) to a Large Language Model (LLM) along with selected customizable inputs (selected from a pop-up) for processing and displays the response in a user-friendly pop-up window. Users can choose webversions of major LLM providers or use API key. This application is designed for macOS and Windows and provides functionality to handle text queries, display results, and save responses (when using API key). This avoids need to getting distracted from what your are reading. Read comprehensive [use cases](https://github.com/drankush/QueryPop/#-use-cases).

## ‚ú® Features 

- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies selected text and processes it from the clipboard.
- **LLM Integration**: Sends text to a chosen Large Language Model by a provider (e.g., OpenAI) for processing. Accepts all OpenAI compatible API.
- **Web-LLM Services**: Supports most web-based LLM services, just sign-in into your account on Chrome browser.
- **Pop-Up Display**: Shows responses or errors in a graphical pop-up window.
- **Markdown to HTML**: Converts markdown responses to HTML for enhanced readability.
- **Response Saving**: Saves responses to a specified directory with timestamps.


## üöÄ Installation 

- Download the `.app` file for Mac or the `.exe` file for Windows from the [releases](https://github.com/drankush/QueryPop/releases).

##  ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **API Details**: Set your API details in the `config.py` file. Accepts all OpenAI compatible API. You can open it by clicking ```Open Config``` in the tray icon.

   ```python
   OPENAI_API_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
   MODEL = "gpt-4o"
   ```

2. **Instruction Prompt**: Customize the instruction prompts by modifying the `INSTRUCTION_PROMPT` variable in the `config.py` file. Take care of following the exact format as provided below.

   For example:
   ```python
    INSTRUCTION_PROMPTS = {
        0: "Key Points Extraction: 'Extract key points from the following text:'",
        1: "Summarization: 'Summarize the following text:'",
        2: "Translation: 'Translate the following text into English:'",
        3: "Explanation: 'Explain the following text in detail:'",
        4: "Question Answering: 'Answer the following question based on the text:'",
        5: "Question Generation: 'Generate Questions based on the text:'",
        6: "Paraphrasing: 'Paraphrase the following text:'",
        7: "Sentiment Analysis: 'Determine the sentiment of the following text:'",
        8: "Topic Modeling: 'Identify the topics in the following text:'",
        9: "Text Simplification: 'Simplify the following text for easier understanding:'",
        10: "Text Expansion: 'Expand the following text on the topic being discussed:'"
    
    }
   ```
3. **Appplication Shortcut**: You can set your own Appplication Shortcut. If you change the application shortcut, then you will have to restart the application to implement it.

   ```python
      APPLICATION_SHORTCUT = "<cmd>+'" # Command+ ' (the apostrophe) on macOS and Control+` (the backtick) on winOS
   ```

   - A list of available key names can be found [here](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#pynput.keyboard.Key).

*The v4 provides optional support to web-based LLM service. It expects users to have Chrome browser installed, logged in to their account and granted [permissions](https://github.com/drankush/QueryPop#-permissions) to accessibility features in built in OS. As you cannot automatically or programmatically extract data or output, this approach is completely compliant with TOS of all LLM service providers.*

4. **Preferred Web Version**: If instead of using API service, you wish to use the web version of LLM service you can input options for the supported services. Currently ```chatgpt```, ```claude```, ```gemini```, ```meta```, ```perplexity``` , ```mistral``` , ```blackbox``` , ```you``` are supported. Leave blank or set to any other value to use API keys.
   ```python
      PREFER_WEBVERSION = "chatgpt"
   ```  

5. **Input Delay for Web Version**: The application tries to input the selected text and the chosen custom intructions using accessibilty features in built in OS. You can change this value depending on your internet speed, after guaging how long the page takes to load.
   ```python
      INPUT_DELAY = "5"  # (in seconds)
   ```
   
6. **Browser Window Size**: This takes the format: {x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height}. For windows only height and width are used.

   ```python
      BROWSER_WINDOW_SIZE = "{100,50,400,700}" # Keep no spaces.
   ```


## üìã Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
