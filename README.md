To streamline the workflow, you can set up keyboard shortcuts to trigger the application after selecting text. 

### üçè On macOS:

1. **Create a Service in Automator**:
   - Open **Automator** and choose **Service**.
   - Set the service to receive **no input** in **any application**.
   - Add the **Run Shell Script** action.
   - Enter the following script, replacing `/path/to/querypop.py` with the path to your application script:

     ```bash
     /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/querypop.py
     ```

   - Save the service with a name like "Run QueryPop".

2. **Set a Keyboard Shortcut**:
   - Open **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Shortcuts**.
   - Select **Services** on the left.
   - Find the service you created ("Run QueryPop") and add a shortcut by clicking **Add Shortcut**.

### ü™ü On Windows:

1. **Create a Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on your desktop and choose **New** > **Shortcut**.
   - Enter the path to your Python executable and the script, e.g.:

     ```bash
     C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\querypop.py
     ```

   - Name the shortcut (e.g., "Run QueryPop").

2. **Set a Keyboard Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on the newly created shortcut and select **Properties**.
